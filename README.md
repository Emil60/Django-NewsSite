# Django-NewsSite
This News Site is for my university project. Database that i used for this project is sqlite. Project consist of user and admin interfaces. Admins can add posts and users have an option to categorise them.
To satisfy requirements run in terminal: pip install -r 'requirements.txt'
To run the server: py manage.py runserver(for Windows OS) (to do it in Linux replace py with python3)
To create admin: py manage.py createsuperuser (and define username password)
